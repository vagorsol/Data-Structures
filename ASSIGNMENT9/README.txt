Reflection:
===========
    This assignment was really daunting, as it asked for a lot to be done, and the additional factor of already being quite stressed
    wasn't particularly helpful. Much like most assignments, it was much easier once I started working and had some sort of idea of 
    what I need to do. This assignment was particularly trick in using and navigating the LinkedLists written in class, and I had a lot
    of trouble when it came to writing an insertion sort method for the program. I am still stuck on how to implement an insertion sort, 
    but otherwise everything else is functional.

I Worked With:
==============
    N/A

Approximate Hours worked:
=========================
    12 hours

Special Instructions to the grader:
===================================
    N/A

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    - While data is entered in to the linked lists, and there is no issues finding and returning said data, the data isn't accurate. 
    This issue likely stems from how my current method of insertion sort moves data around, and not the node itself and its pointers.
    The source could also be how I am updating Names - using get() and set() methods that I wrote - and the tracking to get to the approrpiate
    node may not be accurate. 

Other comments:
===============
    - I really don't like this assignment (even more than the Sudoku assignment).
    - The program takes a long time to load. Sorry!
