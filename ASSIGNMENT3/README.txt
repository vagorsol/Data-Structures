Reflection:
===========
    I struggled significantly less than I did with the previous assignment with getting started, and
    in general, as I am now more familiar with Object Oriented Program. However, I still did struggle 
    a bit because I was at first unsure how inheritance would work in this assignment, 
    and then once I figured it out, I struggled with learning how Array Lists worked.  
    But eventually I learned how Array Lists worked. While I think that some parts could be implemented 
    in a way that's more efficient (lookupZip. lookupZip could probably be done much more efficiently),
    for now I'm satisfied with my results.

Other comments:
===============
    Code from Assignment 2 was reused for PlaceReader.java and Main.java
    Regarding the time estimate: I spent an entire day working on the assignment, but I don't know how many hours I actually spent working on it.
