Reflection:
===========
   As the first assignment, I struggled with knowing how to begin, 
    and even once I figured out what I was being asked to do I struggled throughout 
   because I was unsure how everything worked. But once I understood how Array Lists and
   Buffered Reader worked, everything was more clear to me. Except for the bug.
   Trying to debug refreshed debugging to me, and how updating varibles in Classes work. 
   So, overall, I struggled a lot, but I also learned a lot along the way.
