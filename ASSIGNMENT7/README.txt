Reflection:
===========
    Converting from Binary to Ternary was easier than I expected. In this assignment especially, drawings and
    diagrams were helpful in planning and debugging. Aside from all the issues that arose when I tried testing it out. 
    I found that breakpoints were helpful in helping me debug, but at times they were frustrating to use.  
    I am assuming that they'll be more useful to me after I have more experience with them. I think this assignment 
    went really well, overall, aside for how I am unsure if my testing in the main of TernaryHeap is of a satisfactory amount 
    and/or quality.

Other comments:
===============
    - When I did not have peek() and isEmpty() (from BinaryHeap) copied in TernaryHeap, the program did not work. Only when 
    I copied them to TernaryHeap did the program work. I don't know if that's just how extending classes work, or if there's
    something I did not do. 
    - On occasion, VSC gave me an error along the lines of "TernaryHeap.java is not in the Assignment7 folder" despite it being
    in that folder. When I closed and reopended the folder, the error went away. I don't know why that happened.
