    Part 1:
        - BookReader.java
    Part 2:

        (Map206.java and Map206Interface.java were not touched)
	
How to Compile:
===============
    Special instructions (if any) for compiling the code for each part of the assignment.  It is unlikely that you will have any special instructions
    At the very least, you should include a javac command for each part of the assignment: For example:
    Part 1:
       javac BookReader.java
    Part 2:
       javac ProbeHTInc.java
       javac SepChainHT.java
       
How to Run:
===========
    Part 1:
    	java BookReader
	
Reflection:
===========
    I struggled with managing time on this assignment, which led to me trying (and failing) to complete it all on the final day.
    This assignment has hammered in the fact that I need to balance how much work I do every day so that I don't feel overwhelmed
    and push it off until I don't have enough time to complete it.
    Another struggle with this assignment was confusiong over what was being asked in some points. I think if I had started sooner, 
    this assignment would have been easier. I am planning on trying to complete the assignment afterwards so that I can get the practice
    with Maps.

I Worked With:
==============
    N/A

Approximate Hours worked:
=========================
    7-8 hours.

Special Instructions to the grader:
===================================
    N/A

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
     - 3/14: There was a few cases where SepChainHT.java has erros with BookReader, and sometimes it doesn't. 
        There isn't a clear reason why this happened or if it will repeat. 
     - 3/14: An issue with how nextWord() counts instances. It is likely due to how the parsing of syntax is handled.

Other comments:
===============
    I felt like the instructions for what nextWord() should do were incredibly unclear.
    I started on implementing ProbeHTInc, but I never completed it.
