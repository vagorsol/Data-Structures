Reflection:
===========
    Compared to last week's assignment, I found that I had a much easier time processing 
    and going forward with the task. I think the fact that I spent time organizing and 
    planning before I jumped into programming helped substantially. I still struggled 
    with debugging, but I've found that my ability to identify where the issue is coming 
    from has improved, if only slightly, and there's nothing an agressive amount of 
    printlns can't help solve. 

Time Analysis:
==============
    Compared to BookReader.java (from the last assignment), PalindromeSearcher seemed to 
    be faster. I assume this is because with stacks, it doesn't have to search for the next
    value to retrive. At this point, I haven't finished Assignment 4 so I don't have much here
    and if I don't replace this before submission that's probably still the case.

Other comments:
===============
    I tested PalindromeSearcher's command line reading in bash, and I'm not sure if we were supposed to 
    find a way to run command line arguments in Visual Studio Code.
