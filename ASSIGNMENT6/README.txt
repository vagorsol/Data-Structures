Reflection:
===========
    At first, the assignment was very daunting. But when I focused on just getting the program working,
    and not on the recursion part, it was much easier. Converting to recursion took some time to figure out,
    and it was very intimidating, but once I figured it out, it became much easier. Debugging is still very
    daunting, and I am still not very good at doing it efficiently (my proccess involves a lot of printlns
    everywhere).

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    - I think the fact that I call tempPuzzle in main might be an issue (encapuslation) but I'm not
    sure how else to handle it.

    I don't like this assignment very much.
