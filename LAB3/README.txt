    Part 1:
        HelloWorld.java
    Part 2:
        EchoCount.java
    Part 3:
        Fibonacci.java
	
How to Compile:
===============
    Special instructions (if any) for compiling the code for each part of the assignment.  It is unlikely that you will have any special instructions
    At the very least, you should include a javac command for each part of the assignment: For example:
    Part 1:
       javac HelloWorld.java
    Part 2:
       javac EchoCount.java
    Part 3:
        javac: Fibonacci.java
       
How to Run:
===========
    Special instructions (if any) for running your code of each part of the assignment
    At the very least, here you should say what class contains the main method that you intend to illustrate the runtime behavior of your program.
    For example:
      Part 1:
    	java Count
      Part 3:
        java Fibonacci
	
Reflection:
===========
    A 1 paragraph comment about what went well, or poorly, in the completion of this assignment.  The paragraph might include comments like "The horror, the horror". More seriously, here are some quotes from reflections past (about a rather hard assignment):

     --  It was also a humbling coding experience.
     --  it required a lot of meticulousness. The hardest part honestly was just that I had a ton of bad luck
     --  I was also verrrrrry confused about dealing with bits. I feel the assignment wasn't hard
     --  I simultaneously appreciate the fact that I was forced to make a detailed plan on how to approach each step, and begrudge it because there were so many moving parts and all of them needed to be debugged.
     --  challenge me, to the point where I gave up on finishing it in its entirety ... combining so many elements .. that led me to fail
     --  figure out the big picture of how to organize and structure the code.
     --  My design was poor .. Poor understanding .. Poor understanding on bitwise
     --  very challenging and long for me ... it seemed like everything that could go wrong did and there was a bug at every turn

Approximate Hours worked:
=========================
    3

Special Instructions to the grader:
===================================
As needed -- but generally your code should need no special instructions

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    As needed.  Being forthcoming about bugs is good.  An effective bug analysis will reduce the
    penalty for having that bug by up to 50%.
